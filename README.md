<h2>Welcome </h2>
<p>This is where i store all of the React related code that I didn't want to build an entire project around, reusable snippets, practice tasks and anything else I think might be useful in the future. I also hope it gives you a general overview of where I am, and what I have so far created, with React.</p>
<p>I intend to keep adding to this and improving the overall usefulness of the page by adding code previews, search functionality, filters, direct links to github and more.</p>
<p>Everything on this page was created using React, React Bootstrap and Google Fonts(icons and fonts)</p>
