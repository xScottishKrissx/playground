This is a task designed to re-introduce me to  .fetch and working with API's and react. The idea was to replicate a twitter user profile design using information from the randomuser api (https://randomuser.me/) and for banner image(unsplash.it)

This is to serve as the introduction for further projects that will grow more advanced with each one.
