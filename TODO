Javascript:
  ✔ Calculator @done(12:30 - 04/05/22)
    Todo:
      ✔ Simple Sums @done(18:35 - 27/04/22)
      ✔ Decimal Places @done(16:52 - 29/04/22)
      ✘ CE Button - Cancel current input button @cancelled(15:49 - 29/04/22)
        .. removed this to help simplify things a little for me.
      ✔ AC Button - Clear all input button @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
        ✔ I think i've done it but more checking needed. @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
      ✔ Style calculator @done(12:30 - 03/05/22)
        ✔ I think i need to style the calculator to properly see where i need to improve. @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
        .. that helped a lot. I should consider doing this as standard moving forward(style first -> build functionality.)

      ✘ At the moment the calculation takes place with the solve button, can this be changed to work on number instead? @cancelled(12:30 - 03/05/22)
      ✔ After solving, hitting a number should reset the entire thing. @done(17:26 - 29/04/22)
        ..this is important
        ✔ I think i've managed to achieve this. My codebase is a bombsite but it's doing what I want. @done(17:26 - 29/04/22)

      ✘ If a user hits the solve button without changing the second number, it shoudl solve the equation @cancelled(12:48 - 28/04/22)
        .. 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1.... but without pressing -1 over and over.
        Reason for cancelling -- I dont want this anymore but I think i can do something similiar with the show working function

      Reacitfy Calculator:
        ✔ Split content into separate components and functions. @done(17:33 - 03/05/22)


    Issues:
      ✔ There is some weirdness when subtract 1 from 0 @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
        .. it should solve to -1...right?
      ✔ The first time you add a second number, the display is set to 0 @done(15:51 - 29/04/22)
        .. it display the number on consecutive solves
        .. this is a presentational issue and doesn't appear to affect functionality
      
      ✔ Hitting a number then pressing an operator twice returns a weird output @done(12:15 - 03/05/22)
        .. 1 -> Hit 1
        .. 2 -> Hit + twice
        .. 3 -> result ---- 1 + = 1
        .. ideally you wouldnt be able to active the calculate without a second number

        ✔ Unexpected interactions to fix: @done(17:41 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ pressing a number then =, then attempting to add will return a NaN @done(12:28 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ 1 + 1 then solve, pressing decimal will add a decimal to the second number instead of resetting the display @done(12:24 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ 0 * 1 = 0, then pressing an operator will return a previous number of 1 @done(17:41 - 03/05/22)





  ✔ Simple CRUD @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
      ✔ did this with the todo @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
  ✔ Search Box @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
      ✔ Created a basic search box with dummy data @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
      ✔ Can i apply this to the react micro projects page to search for tags? @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
        Yes, you can.Maybe:
          ✔ Part 1 - Map Components @done(18:55 - 04/05/22)
            ✔ This part was tricky to figure out and my sucesses here doesn't mean the search part is a given but I can now filter components using an object array I manually create. This should me I can filter that object array for names and tags. @done(18:54 - 04/05/22)

          ✔ Part 2 - Searchable Components @done(12:08 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Let's try filtering components. @done(18:58 - 04/05/22)
              .. You can just filter like any other array, the only thing that matters here is how you format the component part.
                .. In the array the component MUST not have quotes
                .. In the map it MUST look like -> <x.componentName /> as an example (componentName matches the object array)

          ✔ Part 3 - Refactoring code to work with new view @done(13:03 - 05/05/22)
            ..I had to create a new view component in order to get the search functionality working the way I want.
            .. Instead of everything being inside app.js, i have created view.js that will instead be the main wrapper for everything as I can't use state app.js.
            ✔ I have rearranged the code so that the page can be searched. The styles are off(the video is totally broken) but the goal of being able to search the components has been achieved. Now I just need to polish and tweak @done(13:03 - 05/05/22)
          
          ✔ Part 4 - Tweaking and Polishing @done(18:56 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Fix video @done(17:24 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Ability to search using tags @done(18:48 - 05/05/22)
            .. create and populate tags
            ✔ Remove old code @done(17:24 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Style search bar and have another look at the navbar @done(18:48 - 05/05/22)

            ✔ Everything is working @done(18:56 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Moving On @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
              ✔ One final thing @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ When searching, i think it should be clearer that a search has been performed. @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ Also it can be clearer what the search bar actually is. @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                  .. also consider just moving the search bar component further down
              ✔ I've just realised I can now add github links for each project @done(12:50 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ Do this. @done(12:50 - 06/05/22)
