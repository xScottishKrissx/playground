React Snippets
https://github.com/dsznajder/vscode-react-javascript-snippets/blob/HEAD/docs/Snippets.md

Javascript:
  ✔ Calculator @done(12:30 - 04/05/22)
    Todo:
      ✔ Simple Sums @done(18:35 - 27/04/22)
      ✔ Decimal Places @done(16:52 - 29/04/22)
      ✘ CE Button - Cancel current input button @cancelled(15:49 - 29/04/22)
        .. removed this to help simplify things a little for me.
      ✔ AC Button - Clear all input button @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
        ✔ I think i've done it but more checking needed. @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
      ✔ Style calculator @done(12:30 - 03/05/22)
        ✔ I think i need to style the calculator to properly see where i need to improve. @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
        .. that helped a lot. I should consider doing this as standard moving forward(style first -> build functionality.)

      ✘ At the moment the calculation takes place with the solve button, can this be changed to work on number instead? @cancelled(12:30 - 03/05/22)
      ✔ After solving, hitting a number should reset the entire thing. @done(17:26 - 29/04/22)
        ..this is important
        ✔ I think i've managed to achieve this. My codebase is a bombsite but it's doing what I want. @done(17:26 - 29/04/22)

      ✘ If a user hits the solve button without changing the second number, it shoudl solve the equation @cancelled(12:48 - 28/04/22)
        .. 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1.... but without pressing -1 over and over.
        Reason for cancelling -- I dont want this anymore but I think i can do something similiar with the show working function

      Reacitfy Calculator:
        ✔ Split content into separate components and functions. @done(17:33 - 03/05/22)


    Issues:
      ✔ There is some weirdness when subtract 1 from 0 @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
        .. it should solve to -1...right?
      ✔ The first time you add a second number, the display is set to 0 @done(15:51 - 29/04/22)
        .. it display the number on consecutive solves
        .. this is a presentational issue and doesn't appear to affect functionality
      
      ✔ Hitting a number then pressing an operator twice returns a weird output @done(12:15 - 03/05/22)
        .. 1 -> Hit 1
        .. 2 -> Hit + twice
        .. 3 -> result ---- 1 + = 1
        .. ideally you wouldnt be able to active the calculate without a second number

        ✔ Unexpected interactions to fix: @done(17:41 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ pressing a number then =, then attempting to add will return a NaN @done(12:28 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ 1 + 1 then solve, pressing decimal will add a decimal to the second number instead of resetting the display @done(12:24 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ 0 * 1 = 0, then pressing an operator will return a previous number of 1 @done(17:41 - 03/05/22)





  ✔ Simple CRUD @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
      ✔ did this with the todo @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
  ✔ Search Box @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
      ✔ Created a basic search box with dummy data @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
      ✔ Can i apply this to the react micro projects page to search for tags? @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
        Yes, you can.Maybe:
          ✔ Part 1 - Map Components @done(18:55 - 04/05/22)
            ✔ This part was tricky to figure out and my sucesses here doesn't mean the search part is a given but I can now filter components using an object array I manually create. This should me I can filter that object array for names and tags. @done(18:54 - 04/05/22)

          ✔ Part 2 - Searchable Components @done(12:08 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Let's try filtering components. @done(18:58 - 04/05/22)
              .. You can just filter like any other array, the only thing that matters here is how you format the component part.
                .. In the array the component MUST not have quotes
                .. In the map it MUST look like -> <x.componentName /> as an example (componentName matches the object array)

          ✔ Part 3 - Refactoring code to work with new view @done(13:03 - 05/05/22)
            ..I had to create a new view component in order to get the search functionality working the way I want.
            .. Instead of everything being inside app.js, i have created view.js that will instead be the main wrapper for everything as I can't use state app.js.
            ✔ I have rearranged the code so that the page can be searched. The styles are off(the video is totally broken) but the goal of being able to search the components has been achieved. Now I just need to polish and tweak @done(13:03 - 05/05/22)
          
          ✔ Part 4 - Tweaking and Polishing @done(18:56 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Fix video @done(17:24 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Ability to search using tags @done(18:48 - 05/05/22)
            .. create and populate tags
            ✔ Remove old code @done(17:24 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Style search bar and have another look at the navbar @done(18:48 - 05/05/22)
            
          ✔ Part 5 - Upload to portfolio @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
            ✔ Everything is working @done(18:56 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Moving On @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
              ✔ One final thing @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ When searching, i think it should be clearer that a search has been performed. @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ Also it can be clearer what the search bar actually is. @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                  .. also consider just moving the search bar component further down
              ✔ I've just realised I can now add github links for each project @done(12:50 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ Do this. @done(12:50 - 06/05/22)

      ✔ Split up into components @done(11:49 - 25/04/22)
        ✔ Got most of it but arrived at the display list map and hit a block. The issue seems to be getting the proper index from the child component to the parent. @done(09:47 - 23/04/22)
      ✔ Assign bootstrap classnames instead of css @done(11:49 - 25/04/22)

  ✔ image slider @done(16:40 - 26/04/22)
      ✔ I thought i was finished but I just realised there is a gap at the edge of the slider container on larger windows. @done(16:40 - 26/04/22)

        Upload Issues:
          ✔ The slider is not set to the correct size on load but resizing the windows sets it. @done(19:17 - 26/04/22)
            ✔ The issue was the useEffect hook setting the height before the images loaded in, i added a check to make sure the images were in place before setting the height of the div. @done(19:18 - 26/04/22)
      ✔ Wasnt there something about DNS changes @done(11:35 - 27/04/22)

      ☐ look into code previews(i.e click om a button to view the project code for each of the tasks)
          ☐ Looked into it, seems a lot more work than I want to dedicate at this point.
      
  ☐ notebook
          .. This would just be a combo of todo + tabs
          
  ✔ simple api + fetch @done(18:39 - 09/05/22)
          Todo:
            .. Idea: a basic component that displays a random user using a button that cycles through and array of people
              ..A fake twitter profile
                
            ✘ Integrate the leaflet js library with the random user api coordinates @cancelled(17:32 - 09/05/22)
              ✔ Just added a link to google maps instead @done(17:32 - 09/05/22)
            ☐ The refresh button stops working after a number of presses.
              .. I can't figure out whats going on here. 
            ✔ Add a verfied tick button if the users age is an even number @done(17:50 - 09/05/22)
            ✔ This file is quite a mess, split it up into components so it's a bit easier to manage. @done(17:32 - 09/05/22)

  RPM Pause:
    ✔ Convert github link to separate component and then... @done(11:07 - 10/05/22)
    ✔ ...add and information button, near the github link, that provides further context for each of the tasks. @done(18:13 - 10/05/22)
      ..this could be in the form of a simple modal that can be open and closed using the information button
      ✔ added the functionality, now just need to style @done(17:32 - 10/05/22)

  covid-19 dashboard using api:
    Inspiration..
      https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/8-reactjs-project-ideas-to-start-learning-by-doing/
    React Leaflet
      https://react-leaflet.js.org/
    Leaflet
      https://leafletjs.com/
    
    Goals:
      Target - https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
      ✔ Primary - A searchable resource for finding information about covid 19 info per country @done(16:47 - 03/06/22)
      ✔ Primary = Ability to view information via a map @done(16:46 - 03/06/22)
      ✔ Secondary - Using search to instanstly filter out countries @done(16:46 - 03/06/22)
      ✔ Secondary - Ability to mark countrys for tracking(like a favourites button) @done(16:46 - 03/06/22)

      ✔ Adjust size of project area to allow for wider/taller projects. @done(15:16 - 17/05/22)
        ..probably another new field in the component list file.
        ..yup, added a size field in component list and added a size check in RMPComponentView to check for size.

    Step 1: Find an Api:
      This is harder that i expected. The UK gov just returns a 500 internal server error.
        ..https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide/main-api
      ✔ Found one = https://disease.sh @done(16:44 - 13/06/22)

    Step 2: Draw the rest of the rabbit:
      ✔ The data is constantly being called, how do i call it once? @done(11:15 - 12/05/22)
        .. add an empty dependency array in the use effect --> []
      console logging the data will return an error
      You can't map an object with a single value, that will return an error
      ✔ How about incorporating the simple slider ui here, having 3 different slides for each of the content @done(16:17 - 17/05/22)
        1.. for the stats, 2.. for the map, 3.. for the graphs
      Figure out how to add data in array together
      ✔ Having multiple fetches is probably not the best, figure out how to make a single function that fetches all URLS needed without having 40+ lines of code very similiar lines of code. @done(13:11 - 18/05/22)
        ✔ Pretty simply solved by using the Promise.all method. @done(13:11 - 18/05/22)

        Todo:
          UI.. 
          ✔ Global Stats Info @done(13:30 - 19/05/22)
          Map:
            ✔ Learn how to integrate maps @done(17:23 - 02/06/22)
            
            ..https://egghead.io/lessons/react-add-geojson-location-data-to-a-map-using-markers-and-popups-in-react-leaflet
            .. very relevant to what I want
            .. i think it's out of date, but a good starting point

            ..https://egghead.io/lessons/react-add-placename-location-search-to-react-leaflet-with-esri-leaflet-geocoder
            .. might also be useful for searching the map
            .. i think it's out of date, but a good starting point

            ✔ Look up destructuring in Js/React @done(17:23 - 02/06/22)
              ..https://medium.com/@lcriswell/destructuring-props-in-react-b1c295005ce0
              Ok its not that complicated. It's just a simpler way of getting information from an array.
              For example, instead of doing something 
                const name = props.name
                const id = props.id
                const age = props.id
              you can do..
                const {name, id, age} = props
              and just use name, id and age without the props. part.
            So, be sure to change this in the covid 19 dashboard and to use this moving forward.
            ✔ THe search box needs to be reworked. The data can be downloaded and loaded inside the search.js component rather than being set in the main Covid19Dashboard @done(17:23 - 02/06/22)
            ✔ Format Tooltips @done(15:31 - 08/06/22)
              ✔ I created a custom panel, now i just need to populate with information and style. @done(15:31 - 08/06/22)
              ✔ Handle no vaccination data error in informationpanel.js @done(16:47 - 08/06/22)

            ✔ Format markers @done(16:18 - 08/06/22)
              ✔ When you click on a marker and panel appears, the map should recenter to specifc position, keeping the country you just clicked on in frame. @done(16:18 - 08/06/22)

            ✔ Search for country and fly to it. @done(16:44 - 13/06/22)
              lets have a look
              Yup, done it. Not that hard, just had to separate the search box into a new component and from there it was simple enough. I have the functionality in place...
              ✔ ... i just need to properly style the new component and integrate with the rest of the map @done(16:44 - 13/06/22)
              ✔ Dragging in the search box drags the map which isn't ideal. @done(13:58 - 10/06/22)
                ✘ Same for double clicking @cancelled(17:25 - 10/06/22)
              ✔ The search button should close the information panel @done(16:07 - 10/06/22)
              

            ✔ Ability mark a country as a favorite for the search.js page @done(14:02 - 09/06/22)
            ✔ Your favourite country should be automatically centred on the map @done(14:02 - 09/06/22)
              ✔ A button that resets the view back to your default @done(16:27 - 10/06/22)
                ✔ I think the icon that represents the favourite and the reset button should be the same in style and colour. @done(17:25 - 13/06/22)

            ✔ The marker showing your fav country should be distinguisable from the rest @done(17:48 - 09/06/22)
                ✔ I've figured out how to change the marker colour, now to update when changing the favoured country @done(17:48 - 09/06/22)
                  ✔ I can get the marker changing, but there's a delay until state updates. @done(17:48 - 09/06/22)
                  ✔ Did it. The solution was to update the map state from the FavCountryView component so that clicking the star would actually be registered in the markers.js file @done(17:48 - 09/06/22)
                  
            ✘ The 3 slides(covodi9DashboardView.js) can be mapped similiar to the component list. This will let me dynamically add more slides with relevant css, without needing to manually adjust in the css file. @cancelled(16:49 - 13/06/22)
              ✔ I cant' im passing in props, which the RMPComponent view doesn't need because they're just the components themselves. @done(16:49 - 13/06/22)

            ✔ The map is just a mess on smaller windows. @done(15:31 - 08/06/22)
              ..not a lot i can do about that really

            ✔ There's an issue with the markers where clicking back and forward between the favorite and another marker will cause the markers to move positions. @done(17:45 - 10/06/22)
              ✔ I have narrowed it down to the initial call in map.js where I set the favCountryLat and long. Removing the localstorage aspect stops the switching. I'm guessing Im not properly dealing the location somewhere in the dashboard. @done(17:45 - 10/06/22)
              ✔ ...im not setting the lat into local storage anywhere. It also doesn't make sense as the issue is affecting ALL markers, this local storage is only for the favorite location data. @done(17:45 - 10/06/22)
              ✔ FOUND IT. It's in toggleInfoPanel, the flyTo that moves the map to the correct positon near the marker. Why it's causing this issue im not sure but at least I know where to start. @done(17:45 - 10/06/22)
              ✔ FIX. I changed the flyTo, to setView and that fixed the problem. I'm not bothered by either of these effects so this change causes minimal issue to me. @done(17:45 - 10/06/22)

            ✔ You can search a country and get a chart visualising various pieces of data from that country @done(17:24 - 02/06/22)
            Notes
              .. The API data isn't laid out exactly how I would like it with differences in how country data is reported eg. USA gets 1 array for 50 states, Canada gets 15 arrays for each of its provinces and the UK gets arrays for all of its overseas territories and dependencies but NOT the 4 countries that make up the UK.
              .. Short of figuring out a way of adding value in arrays to other arrays, I am just going to accept I can't have graphs for all countries that list data like this.

              ✔ 2 sections @done(17:30 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ 1st Section - Search Box - Latest Data @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                  ✔ Add more info and format @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                  ✔ Not sure how to style this area, i am thinking about a similiar style to the total stats page but smaller more compact version. @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                  ✔ There's a lot of data here which is a bit of a pain to work with so I tried using a map. This get this information onto the page quickly but I have no way of customising the display. The information is displayed the way it leaves the array. I want to be able separate elements into sections and the map is to strict for this. I could probably create a number of filters to check for the correct "thing" to separate between deaths, cases, recovered etc but at that point it is probably just more efficient to hardcode all of the divs like I was doing. Which is what I am going to do. @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                  ✔ I am pretty happy with the latest stats section overall. @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ 2nd Section - Graphs - Timeline Data @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                    ✔ Add more info and format @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
              ✔ There's a lot of conditional operation going on. I think it's all necessary because of the variety and quality of data i have, but it's still a bit complicated at certain points as to what is being shown and what isn't. @done(17:41 - 01/06/22)
              ✔ I need to move the graphs into latest.js because that's where it should be. You will never get a graph without a country which is determined in the lasest stats file. @done(13:19 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ I'm realising my file structure is a bit of a mess. I think i need to do a bit of reorganising. The current search.js should be a container for a latest.js file(renamed to searchView.js) that contains the current latest.js and the graph.js components. @done(13:19 - 02/06/22)
              
              ✔ Improve the loading gif @done(17:57 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ ..by getting a better image @done(17:57 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ ..by spinning off into its own component. @done(17:44 - 02/06/22)
              ✔ Improve performance on smaller windows @done(18:05 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ ..Desktop is fine @done(17:29 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ ..tablet @done(18:05 - 02/06/22)
                  ✔ the disclaimer gets lost at the bottom of the page @done(18:05 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ ..mobile is fine as long as the dislcaimer gets fixed @done(18:05 - 02/06/22)
              ✔ Add an updated field to the slide @done(18:29 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ create a component for this @done(15:36 - 03/06/22)
              ✔ the latest stats display should have it's own component @done(18:17 - 02/06/22)
                .. it's taking a lot of space
              ✔ The ability to change the starting country from the UK @done(16:44 - 03/06/22)
                .. i feel like this is pretty easily done using local storage.
                  ..yup
                  ✔ Added the button, now just to finish of styling @done(16:44 - 03/06/22)

              ✔ The search functionality is case sensitive, anything I can do about this? @done(18:05 - 03/06/22)
                ..the main issue is that im doing multiple filters and Im having a hard time figuring out what to compare.
                ✔ I've figured out how to allow for case insensitive matches but now there's an issue where spain, Spain, sPaiN and SPAIn are all different things and can be favourited. @done(18:05 - 03/06/22)
                  ✔ I have solved this be converting everything to lower case when being compared and then displaying the country name in upper case. This has solved the issue. @done(18:05 - 03/06/22)

            ✔ In general i think being able to see the increase in cases from the previous 2 days would be quite useful @done(16:43 - 13/06/22)
            .. sum (today - yesterday) = increase in cases
              ✔ I think my data sources are way too different at this point, reporting different data from different sources. The graphs and stats are always going to be slightly different so it's mostly pointless @done(16:43 - 13/06/22)



          ✔ I think i need to take a step back and start from the basics. Im trying to shoehorn chart.js into my project without actually knowing how it fully works. Instead of using the covid data, i will create a small mini side project to help me get to grips with the library @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
          SimpleChart Side Project:
            ✔ Should use a fetch @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
            ✔ Be very simple, this is just to help with the covid19 dashboard. @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
              ✔ It is actually very simple and I was able to get good progress but Destiny 2 new season hype is too distracting @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
              ✔ Nothing too complicated here, you just need to get the data into the right format and it's plug and play. @done(16:28 - 31/05/22)
          
      
        ✔ Style / reformat buttons @done(16:03 - 06/06/22)
          ..they work but the current styling can be improved.
          ✔ first off all, swap them around. they're very annoying to use @done(16:03 - 06/06/22)

    Final Polishing:
      physical device - Pixel 3a, 2560x1440 165hz monitor
      chrome virtual device - Pixel 5, iPhone SE, iPhone 12Pro, Samsung Galazy S8
      browser - chrome, firefox, edge

      Map View:
        ✔ On mobile, can you pinch to zoom the map in and out? @done(16:02 - 16/06/22)
          ✔ yes @done(16:02 - 16/06/22)
        ✔ Mobile -> Information panel is totally borked, fix the spacing here. @done(12:58 - 14/06/22)
        ✔ Mobile -> Information panel font size is ugly as hell @done(12:58 - 14/06/22)
        ✔ Mobile -> Perhaps, favouriting a country should happen after clicking anywhere in the name, rather than just the star which might be tricky to press @done(13:19 - 14/06/22)
        ✘ Mobile -> The markers are way too big and in the wrong place, might be an issue. @cancelled(16:00 - 16/06/22)
          ✔ Might be a virtual emulation issue @done(11:56 - 16/06/22)
            ✔ It's not but I'm not sure what to do about this @done(16:00 - 16/06/22)
            ✔ The marker size -> Set a width of 25px which is the same as on desktop and should be fine on mobile. This also solves the position problem. 
            @done(16:00 - 16/06/22)
              ✔ This didn't fix it and i dont know what else to do. So i am moving on and will come back and fix it if I get any ideas @done(16:01 - 16/06/22)
        ✔ Mobile -> The loading dashboard signal should be in the middle of the page and in a column configuration @done(13:25 - 14/06/22)
      Global Stats:
        ✔ Mobile -> Maybe increase the padding on the left and right as the bigger numbers are getting closer to the edges @done(13:44 - 14/06/22)
        ✔ Mobile -> There's a lot of white space at the bottom of the page. @done(13:44 - 14/06/22)
        ✔ Mobile -> The stats just look wonky, whats this about? @done(13:45 - 14/06/22)
      Search:
        ✔ Mobile -> The title and the search bar are cramped, switch to flex column and change the colour of the search box to be sligtly easier to see. @done(16:40 - 14/06/22)
          ✔ I think this can be spread the area straight below as well, way overcrowded here. @done(17:22 - 15/06/22)
        ✔ Mobile -> Again, space around the borders is an issue here, especially in the updated string @done(17:22 - 15/06/22)
        ✔ Mobile -> The disclaimer is halfway off the bottom of the page. @done(17:22 - 15/06/22)
          ✘ I think i might need to redo this entire thing using a map. There's too many divs on page and I can probably remove things from the array easier than it is currently wrangling 40 different divs, cols and rows into a design. @cancelled(17:22 - 15/06/22)
            ✘ Redo this. @cancelled(17:22 - 15/06/22)
          ✔ Or is it? @done(17:22 - 15/06/22)
            ✔ ...maybe I just need to create better structure for the page. @done(17:22 - 15/06/22)
      I think most of the initial polishing is complete, the next stage would be to get the dashboard onto the portfolio so i can test with a real mobile.

  RMP Polishing Break:
    ✔ The website looks very rough on my phone, do a pass on everything and make tweaks where appropriate to fix any issues. @done(18:15 - 17/06/22)
      ✔ Remove the sticky navbar, just keep it in place. @done(17:56 - 13/06/22)
      375px:
        ✔ The dropdown menu looks naff, a bit more separation from the title. @done(15:41 - 17/06/22)
        ✔ The main search bar looks naff @done(15:43 - 17/06/22)
        ✔ Simple API -> there is text going off screen @done(15:51 - 17/06/22)

        ✔ Add a hide section button to each project. @done(17:57 - 17/06/22)
          ✔ A structure where eask project can be hidden. @done(17:57 - 17/06/22)
            ✔ ...then unhidden all at once @done(17:57 - 17/06/22)
          ✔ I don't think an accordion like system is viable due to the differing sizes of each project. A simple hide/unhide all is probably the best way forward. @done(17:57 - 17/06/22)
          ✔ It shouldn't affect the search result number and it should be highlighted if that projects are hidden AT ALL TIMES. @done(17:57 - 17/06/22)
    ✔ There is a lot of white space to the right when view on my phone. @done(18:04 - 17/06/22)
        ✔ ...testing and fixed. @done(18:04 - 17/06/22)
        ... this was fixed in the above fixes, i just hadnt uploaded a new build

  Basic Drag and Drop functionality:
  ..like a trello mimic?
    ✔ Using React Drag and Drop Library @done(17:58 - 22/06/22)
        https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/
      ✔ Started the Official React Drag and Drop tutorial but wasn't following along to well. Found a better(much clearer) example on YouTube and I'm following that. @done(17:58 - 22/06/22)
        ✔ I followed that tutorial and managed to create a simple drag and drop interface. Now i am going to play around with it, read the docs and see what I can do and overall understand the library more. @done(17:55 - 22/06/22)
        ✔ I feel like It's not too hard. I think if I try and now move on to a new task, with more advanced goals in mind, i should be fine. @done(17:58 - 22/06/22)
        Mini Goals:
          ✔ Description of what each piece can do @done(16:28 - 22/06/22)
            ✔ Try and get more chess pictures @done(16:28 - 22/06/22)
          ✔ Move the images data object to separate file @done(16:44 - 22/06/22)
          ✔ Reset Board Button @done(16:53 - 22/06/22)
          ✔ Add effect to board when hovering with droppable @done(17:48 - 22/06/22)
            ✔ How about an effect that happens when dragging but NOT over the board @done(17:48 - 22/06/22)
            ... I think i am understanding this more. The useDrag, useDrop hooks have an array of options that return true/false that you can assign to state and then use to change things on the page.
    Porfolio Checklist:
      ☐ Clean up rough edges
        ✔ Optimised image sizes and dimensions @done(16:30 - 24/06/22)
        ✘ Can i change the mouse while the image is being dragged? @cancelled(18:19 - 24/06/22)
      ☐ Device check
        ☐ I added a line that checks for the device and switches the backend. This should mean the project should work on both mobiles and desktops.
          ☐ Amend description
          Remove if the above is correct
          WARNING:: will not work on tablet or mobile devices. There is touch support in the Drag and Drop library, but I felt that would be going too far for a simple project like this. This is just getting to to grips with the basics.

  Task Board(using drag and drop):
    ☐ Basically trying to achieve something like trello
    ☐ Add Task
      ☐ A simple form that adds a value to an array
    ☐ 3 Boards
      ☐ Task(yet to start)
      ☐ In Progress
      ☐ Completed
    
    ✔ Things to figure out @done(16:58 - 05/07/22)
      ✔ How to remove an item from it's original position after being dropped @done(16:58 - 05/07/22)
        ✔ I have no idea what I am doing or what is going. The board.js useDrop  just stops working after adding a single thing to the tasks array. I don't know how to fix and have no idea how to procede. I might have to start again because this is a mess. @done(16:57 - 05/07/22)
     

    TBoard - Starting Over:
      ✔ I think i tried to do too much to quickly and confused myself. So i am going to start again and be more careful with what Im doing. @done(16:56 - 05/07/22)
        ✔ Ability to add something to the page @done(12:14 - 30/06/22)
        ✔ Save that to local storage and the display on reload @done(12:13 - 30/06/22)
        ✔ I think i've set a decent base, now i need to add dragging. @done(12:26 - 30/06/22)
          ✔ Added dragging to current tasks, now dropping @done(12:36 - 30/06/22)
          ✔ I have the item triggering the drop area, but It's not returning the id as expected.  Still, solid progress. @done(12:42 - 30/06/22)
            ✔ Cracked it, i was missing the item:{id:props.id} is the drag function that matches the item.id in the drop function. @done(12:42 - 30/06/22)
              ✔ At the moment the drop function is removing items from the current tasks, this fine. I also need it to add to the in Progress board. @done(13:31 - 30/06/22)
              ✔ Done. You can now drag items across from the current tasks board to the inProgress board and they will drop and stay in place through page load. @done(13:31 - 30/06/22)
              ✔ How about dragging back to current task from in progress? @done(16:54 - 05/07/22)
                ✔ It's a bit of a mess but i think im getting somewhere. I can drag items back from in progress, but they're not being removed from in progress. It's something in the removeFromInProgress function. @done(15:22 - 30/06/22)
                  ✔ Got it, it's a total mess but i now have elements being dragged and dropped across both boards @done(15:23 - 30/06/22)
                ✔ The next step here is to reduce the duplicate code being used here @done(16:54 - 05/07/22)
                  ✔ created a remove from board function that replaces the current 2 @done(17:18 - 30/06/22)
                  ✔ Added a counter,saved in local storage, to assign item ids. @done(17:11 - 30/06/22)
                  ✔ Created a add to board that replaces 2 of the 3. The add new item might need to be separate but I haven't properly looked. I'm more concerned about the 3rd board. I think my solution for the addToBoard is a little too binary. @done(16:54 - 05/07/22)
                    ✘ Can you get the id of the thing you're currently dragged over? @cancelled(16:54 - 05/07/22)

                ✔ I've had an idea, what if instead of having 3 different arrays, i had 1 array with a board property that I could use to determine which boards exist and where items are displayed. @done(16:54 - 05/07/22)
                  ✔ I've added code to the drop functions that pass a name to the addToBoard function. This then changes the board property of the array to the new target board. @done(15:38 - 05/07/22)
                  ✔ I think i should now create a single array and output the contents of this array to each board based on the board name property. @done(15:38 - 05/07/22)
                  ✔ I think this is the better way but I can't untangle this current version. I will need to start again again to make this properly work. The code's a mess and Im making a complete meal of what should be a simple thing. I'm not happy with my work in this project and its frustrating me. @done(15:38 - 05/07/22)
                  ✔ The main issue was that I wasn't doing a JSON.stringify when setting storage which caused some issues. I think restarting was a the correct call anyway as it was pointless to try and refactor the code from that position. @done(15:38 - 05/07/22)
                  ✔ Carrying on with this in a new version of this: tbored @done(16:54 - 05/07/22)
                    ✔ Going through the same steps as above, only using 1 array with columns instead of multiple dedicated arrays for each board. @done(16:54 - 05/07/22)
                    ✔ Caught Up @done(16:54 - 05/07/22)

        ✔ I can drag and drop items to re-arrange items @done(15:35 - 11/07/22)

          ✘ better feedback for dropping an item into a new board @cancelled(16:00 - 14/07/22)
      ✘ How to add boards dynamically @cancelled(16:00 - 14/07/22)
        ✘ I feel like this is easy as all I need is a board name. @cancelled(16:00 - 14/07/22)
      ✔ Separate code into components before this get's too messy. @done(17:03 - 06/07/22)

          ✘ Bug: Dragging a draggable over itself will crash the page and require a cache clear. @cancelled(16:54 - 05/07/22)
          ✔ Bug: Add 2 items and drag one to inProgress. Then add a new item and when you attempt to drag it to inProgress, it vanishes @started(16:43 - 06/07/22) @done(17:03 - 06/07/22) @lasted(20m21s)
            ✔ Solved this by adding a localStorage.getItem instead of the items prop. Not sure how else to fix this. I imagine it has something to do with the way state is set/called but i can't figure it out. @done(17:03 - 06/07/22)
    
    ✔ Trying something else. @done(16:00 - 14/07/22)
      ✔ react-dnd isn't really working for me. I'm not in a position to really pass judgment but i find the documentation to be a bit too vague(on top of the examples not actually working) and trying to use both react-dnd and reacts built in drag and drop, i don't think i am working well with the library. That is probably on me but i'm really not feeling it. @done(16:00 - 14/07/22)
      ✔ So i have decided to(again) start over but this time i am using the react-beautiful-dnd library which seems more along my street. Especially as it's designed around lists and moving lists between columns. @done(16:00 - 14/07/22)

  task board(with react-beautiful-dnd):
    ✔ Install react-beautfiul dnd and get started @done(16:00 - 14/07/22)
    .. download
    https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd
    .. tutorial
    https://egghead.io/lessons/react-course-introduction-beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd
    ✔ So i've been following  a tutorial and ran into an issue where the above library wouldn't work with Strict Mode. I have since disabled Strict Mode, letting me carry on. @done(16:00 - 14/07/22)
    ✔ Ok so i've made a mess of the tutorial im doing but I do understand what's going on. I tried to be a smart arse but got ahead of myself and then got confused so i am going to start again. I know, another restart but this is the first time I'm restarting because I know i can do better. Previously I was restarting because I had no idea what was happening but now I do, i just want to rewind a bit and make sure the end product is as good as I can make it. @done(16:00 - 14/07/22)
      ✔ restart again @done(16:00 - 14/07/22)
      ✔ Tutorial Complete, now to turn it into my own thing @done(16:00 - 14/07/22)
