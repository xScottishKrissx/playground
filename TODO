Javascript:
  ☐ Calculator
    Todo:
      ✔ Simple Sums @done(18:35 - 27/04/22)
      ✔ Decimal Places @done(16:52 - 29/04/22)
      ✘ CE Button - Cancel current input button @cancelled(15:49 - 29/04/22)
        .. removed this to help simplify things a little for me.
      ✔ AC Button - Clear all input button @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
        ✔ I think i've done it but more checking needed. @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
      ✔ Style calculator @done(12:30 - 03/05/22)
        ✔ I think i need to style the calculator to properly see where i need to improve. @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
        .. that helped a lot. I should consider doing this as standard moving forward(style first -> build functionality.)

      ✘ At the moment the calculation takes place with the solve button, can this be changed to work on number instead? @cancelled(12:30 - 03/05/22)
      ✔ After solving, hitting a number should reset the entire thing. @done(17:26 - 29/04/22)
        ..this is important
        ✔ I think i've managed to achieve this. My codebase is a bombsite but it's doing what I want. @done(17:26 - 29/04/22)

      ✘ If a user hits the solve button without changing the second number, it shoudl solve the equation @cancelled(12:48 - 28/04/22)
        .. 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1.... but without pressing -1 over and over.
        Reason for cancelling -- I dont want this anymore but I think i can do something similiar with the show working function

      Reacitfy Calculator:
        ☐ Split content into separate components and functions.


    Issues:
      ✔ There is some weirdness when subtract 1 from 0 @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
        .. it should solve to -1...right?
      ✔ The first time you add a second number, the display is set to 0 @done(15:51 - 29/04/22)
        .. it display the number on consecutive solves
        .. this is a presentational issue and doesn't appear to affect functionality
      
      ✔ Hitting a number then pressing an operator twice returns a weird output @done(12:15 - 03/05/22)
        .. 1 -> Hit 1
        .. 2 -> Hit + twice
        .. 3 -> result ---- 1 + = 1
        .. ideally you wouldnt be able to active the calculate without a second number

        ✔ Unexpected interactions to fix: @done(12:30 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ pressing a number then =, then attempting to add will return a NaN @done(12:28 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ 1 + 1 then solve, pressing decimal will add a decimal to the second number instead of resetting the display @done(12:24 - 03/05/22)
