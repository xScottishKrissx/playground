React Snippets
https://github.com/dsznajder/vscode-react-javascript-snippets/blob/HEAD/docs/Snippets.md

Javascript:
  ✔ Calculator @done(12:30 - 04/05/22)
    Todo:
      ✔ Simple Sums @done(18:35 - 27/04/22)
      ✔ Decimal Places @done(16:52 - 29/04/22)
      ✘ CE Button - Cancel current input button @cancelled(15:49 - 29/04/22)
        .. removed this to help simplify things a little for me.
      ✔ AC Button - Clear all input button @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
        ✔ I think i've done it but more checking needed. @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
      ✔ Style calculator @done(12:30 - 03/05/22)
        ✔ I think i need to style the calculator to properly see where i need to improve. @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
        .. that helped a lot. I should consider doing this as standard moving forward(style first -> build functionality.)

      ✘ At the moment the calculation takes place with the solve button, can this be changed to work on number instead? @cancelled(12:30 - 03/05/22)
      ✔ After solving, hitting a number should reset the entire thing. @done(17:26 - 29/04/22)
        ..this is important
        ✔ I think i've managed to achieve this. My codebase is a bombsite but it's doing what I want. @done(17:26 - 29/04/22)

      ✘ If a user hits the solve button without changing the second number, it shoudl solve the equation @cancelled(12:48 - 28/04/22)
        .. 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1.... but without pressing -1 over and over.
        Reason for cancelling -- I dont want this anymore but I think i can do something similiar with the show working function

      Reacitfy Calculator:
        ✔ Split content into separate components and functions. @done(17:33 - 03/05/22)


    Issues:
      ✔ There is some weirdness when subtract 1 from 0 @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
        .. it should solve to -1...right?
      ✔ The first time you add a second number, the display is set to 0 @done(15:51 - 29/04/22)
        .. it display the number on consecutive solves
        .. this is a presentational issue and doesn't appear to affect functionality
      
      ✔ Hitting a number then pressing an operator twice returns a weird output @done(12:15 - 03/05/22)
        .. 1 -> Hit 1
        .. 2 -> Hit + twice
        .. 3 -> result ---- 1 + = 1
        .. ideally you wouldnt be able to active the calculate without a second number

        ✔ Unexpected interactions to fix: @done(17:41 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ pressing a number then =, then attempting to add will return a NaN @done(12:28 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ 1 + 1 then solve, pressing decimal will add a decimal to the second number instead of resetting the display @done(12:24 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ 0 * 1 = 0, then pressing an operator will return a previous number of 1 @done(17:41 - 03/05/22)





  ✔ Simple CRUD @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
      ✔ did this with the todo @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
  ✔ Search Box @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
      ✔ Created a basic search box with dummy data @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
      ✔ Can i apply this to the react micro projects page to search for tags? @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
        Yes, you can.Maybe:
          ✔ Part 1 - Map Components @done(18:55 - 04/05/22)
            ✔ This part was tricky to figure out and my sucesses here doesn't mean the search part is a given but I can now filter components using an object array I manually create. This should me I can filter that object array for names and tags. @done(18:54 - 04/05/22)

          ✔ Part 2 - Searchable Components @done(12:08 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Let's try filtering components. @done(18:58 - 04/05/22)
              .. You can just filter like any other array, the only thing that matters here is how you format the component part.
                .. In the array the component MUST not have quotes
                .. In the map it MUST look like -> <x.componentName /> as an example (componentName matches the object array)

          ✔ Part 3 - Refactoring code to work with new view @done(13:03 - 05/05/22)
            ..I had to create a new view component in order to get the search functionality working the way I want.
            .. Instead of everything being inside app.js, i have created view.js that will instead be the main wrapper for everything as I can't use state app.js.
            ✔ I have rearranged the code so that the page can be searched. The styles are off(the video is totally broken) but the goal of being able to search the components has been achieved. Now I just need to polish and tweak @done(13:03 - 05/05/22)
          
          ✔ Part 4 - Tweaking and Polishing @done(18:56 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Fix video @done(17:24 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Ability to search using tags @done(18:48 - 05/05/22)
            .. create and populate tags
            ✔ Remove old code @done(17:24 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Style search bar and have another look at the navbar @done(18:48 - 05/05/22)
            
          ✔ Part 5 - Upload to portfolio @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
            ✔ Everything is working @done(18:56 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Moving On @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
              ✔ One final thing @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ When searching, i think it should be clearer that a search has been performed. @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ Also it can be clearer what the search bar actually is. @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                  .. also consider just moving the search bar component further down
              ✔ I've just realised I can now add github links for each project @done(12:50 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ Do this. @done(12:50 - 06/05/22)

      ✔ Split up into components @done(11:49 - 25/04/22)
        ✔ Got most of it but arrived at the display list map and hit a block. The issue seems to be getting the proper index from the child component to the parent. @done(09:47 - 23/04/22)
      ✔ Assign bootstrap classnames instead of css @done(11:49 - 25/04/22)

  ✔ image slider @done(16:40 - 26/04/22)
      ✔ I thought i was finished but I just realised there is a gap at the edge of the slider container on larger windows. @done(16:40 - 26/04/22)

        Upload Issues:
          ✔ The slider is not set to the correct size on load but resizing the windows sets it. @done(19:17 - 26/04/22)
            ✔ The issue was the useEffect hook setting the height before the images loaded in, i added a check to make sure the images were in place before setting the height of the div. @done(19:18 - 26/04/22)
      ✔ Wasnt there something about DNS changes @done(11:35 - 27/04/22)

      ☐ look into code previews(i.e click om a button to view the project code for each of the tasks)
          ☐ Looked into it, seems a lot more work than I want to dedicate at this point.
      
  ☐ notebook
          .. This would just be a combo of todo + tabs
          
  ✔ simple api + fetch @done(18:39 - 09/05/22)
          Todo:
            .. Idea: a basic component that displays a random user using a button that cycles through and array of people
              ..A fake twitter profile
                
            ✘ Integrate the leaflet js library with the random user api coordinates @cancelled(17:32 - 09/05/22)
              ✔ Just added a link to google maps instead @done(17:32 - 09/05/22)
            ☐ The refresh button stops working after a number of presses.
              .. I can't figure out whats going on here. 
            ✔ Add a verfied tick button if the users age is an even number @done(17:50 - 09/05/22)
            ✔ This file is quite a mess, split it up into components so it's a bit easier to manage. @done(17:32 - 09/05/22)

  RPM Pause:
    ✔ Convert github link to separate component and then... @done(11:07 - 10/05/22)
    ✔ ...add and information button, near the github link, that provides further context for each of the tasks. @done(18:13 - 10/05/22)
      ..this could be in the form of a simple modal that can be open and closed using the information button
      ✔ added the functionality, now just need to style @done(17:32 - 10/05/22)

  covid-19 dashboard using api:
    Inspiration..
      https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/8-reactjs-project-ideas-to-start-learning-by-doing/
    React Leaflet
      https://react-leaflet.js.org/
    Leaflet
      https://leafletjs.com/
    
    Goals:
      Target - https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
      ✔ Primary - A searchable resource for finding information about covid 19 info per country @done(16:47 - 03/06/22)
      ✔ Primary = Ability to view information via a map @done(16:46 - 03/06/22)
      ✔ Secondary - Using search to instanstly filter out countries @done(16:46 - 03/06/22)
      ✔ Secondary - Ability to mark countrys for tracking(like a favourites button) @done(16:46 - 03/06/22)

      ✔ Adjust size of project area to allow for wider/taller projects. @done(15:16 - 17/05/22)
        ..probably another new field in the component list file.
        ..yup, added a size field in component list and added a size check in RMPComponentView to check for size.

    Step 1: Find an Api:
      This is harder that i expected. The UK gov just returns a 500 internal server error.
        ..https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide/main-api
      ✔ Found one = https://disease.sh @done(16:44 - 13/06/22)

    Step 2: Draw the rest of the rabbit:
      ✔ The data is constantly being called, how do i call it once? @done(11:15 - 12/05/22)
        .. add an empty dependency array in the use effect --> []
      console logging the data will return an error
      You can't map an object with a single value, that will return an error
      ✔ How about incorporating the simple slider ui here, having 3 different slides for each of the content @done(16:17 - 17/05/22)
        1.. for the stats, 2.. for the map, 3.. for the graphs
      Figure out how to add data in array together
      ✔ Having multiple fetches is probably not the best, figure out how to make a single function that fetches all URLS needed without having 40+ lines of code very similiar lines of code. @done(13:11 - 18/05/22)
        ✔ Pretty simply solved by using the Promise.all method. @done(13:11 - 18/05/22)

        Todo:
          UI.. 
          ✔ Global Stats Info @done(13:30 - 19/05/22)
          Map:
            ✔ Learn how to integrate maps @done(17:23 - 02/06/22)
            
            ..https://egghead.io/lessons/react-add-geojson-location-data-to-a-map-using-markers-and-popups-in-react-leaflet
            .. very relevant to what I want
            .. i think it's out of date, but a good starting point

            ..https://egghead.io/lessons/react-add-placename-location-search-to-react-leaflet-with-esri-leaflet-geocoder
            .. might also be useful for searching the map
            .. i think it's out of date, but a good starting point

            ✔ Look up destructuring in Js/React @done(17:23 - 02/06/22)
              ..https://medium.com/@lcriswell/destructuring-props-in-react-b1c295005ce0
              Ok its not that complicated. It's just a simpler way of getting information from an array.
              For example, instead of doing something 
                const name = props.name
                const id = props.id
                const age = props.id
              you can do..
                const {name, id, age} = props
              and just use name, id and age without the props. part.
            So, be sure to change this in the covid 19 dashboard and to use this moving forward.
            ✔ THe search box needs to be reworked. The data can be downloaded and loaded inside the search.js component rather than being set in the main Covid19Dashboard @done(17:23 - 02/06/22)
            ✔ Format Tooltips @done(15:31 - 08/06/22)
              ✔ I created a custom panel, now i just need to populate with information and style. @done(15:31 - 08/06/22)
              ✔ Handle no vaccination data error in informationpanel.js @done(16:47 - 08/06/22)

            ✔ Format markers @done(16:18 - 08/06/22)
              ✔ When you click on a marker and panel appears, the map should recenter to specifc position, keeping the country you just clicked on in frame. @done(16:18 - 08/06/22)

            ✔ Search for country and fly to it. @done(16:44 - 13/06/22)
              lets have a look
              Yup, done it. Not that hard, just had to separate the search box into a new component and from there it was simple enough. I have the functionality in place...
              ✔ ... i just need to properly style the new component and integrate with the rest of the map @done(16:44 - 13/06/22)
              ✔ Dragging in the search box drags the map which isn't ideal. @done(13:58 - 10/06/22)
                ✘ Same for double clicking @cancelled(17:25 - 10/06/22)
              ✔ The search button should close the information panel @done(16:07 - 10/06/22)
              

            ✔ Ability mark a country as a favorite for the search.js page @done(14:02 - 09/06/22)
            ✔ Your favourite country should be automatically centred on the map @done(14:02 - 09/06/22)
              ✔ A button that resets the view back to your default @done(16:27 - 10/06/22)
                ✔ I think the icon that represents the favourite and the reset button should be the same in style and colour. @done(17:25 - 13/06/22)

            ✔ The marker showing your fav country should be distinguisable from the rest @done(17:48 - 09/06/22)
                ✔ I've figured out how to change the marker colour, now to update when changing the favoured country @done(17:48 - 09/06/22)
                  ✔ I can get the marker changing, but there's a delay until state updates. @done(17:48 - 09/06/22)
                  ✔ Did it. The solution was to update the map state from the FavCountryView component so that clicking the star would actually be registered in the markers.js file @done(17:48 - 09/06/22)
                  
            ✘ The 3 slides(covodi9DashboardView.js) can be mapped similiar to the component list. This will let me dynamically add more slides with relevant css, without needing to manually adjust in the css file. @cancelled(16:49 - 13/06/22)
              ✔ I cant' im passing in props, which the RMPComponent view doesn't need because they're just the components themselves. @done(16:49 - 13/06/22)

            ✔ The map is just a mess on smaller windows. @done(15:31 - 08/06/22)
              ..not a lot i can do about that really

            ✔ There's an issue with the markers where clicking back and forward between the favorite and another marker will cause the markers to move positions. @done(17:45 - 10/06/22)
              ✔ I have narrowed it down to the initial call in map.js where I set the favCountryLat and long. Removing the localstorage aspect stops the switching. I'm guessing Im not properly dealing the location somewhere in the dashboard. @done(17:45 - 10/06/22)
              ✔ ...im not setting the lat into local storage anywhere. It also doesn't make sense as the issue is affecting ALL markers, this local storage is only for the favorite location data. @done(17:45 - 10/06/22)
              ✔ FOUND IT. It's in toggleInfoPanel, the flyTo that moves the map to the correct positon near the marker. Why it's causing this issue im not sure but at least I know where to start. @done(17:45 - 10/06/22)
              ✔ FIX. I changed the flyTo, to setView and that fixed the problem. I'm not bothered by either of these effects so this change causes minimal issue to me. @done(17:45 - 10/06/22)

            ✔ You can search a country and get a chart visualising various pieces of data from that country @done(17:24 - 02/06/22)
            Notes
              .. The API data isn't laid out exactly how I would like it with differences in how country data is reported eg. USA gets 1 array for 50 states, Canada gets 15 arrays for each of its provinces and the UK gets arrays for all of its overseas territories and dependencies but NOT the 4 countries that make up the UK.
              .. Short of figuring out a way of adding value in arrays to other arrays, I am just going to accept I can't have graphs for all countries that list data like this.

              ✔ 2 sections @done(17:30 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ 1st Section - Search Box - Latest Data @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                  ✔ Add more info and format @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                  ✔ Not sure how to style this area, i am thinking about a similiar style to the total stats page but smaller more compact version. @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                  ✔ There's a lot of data here which is a bit of a pain to work with so I tried using a map. This get this information onto the page quickly but I have no way of customising the display. The information is displayed the way it leaves the array. I want to be able separate elements into sections and the map is to strict for this. I could probably create a number of filters to check for the correct "thing" to separate between deaths, cases, recovered etc but at that point it is probably just more efficient to hardcode all of the divs like I was doing. Which is what I am going to do. @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                  ✔ I am pretty happy with the latest stats section overall. @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ 2nd Section - Graphs - Timeline Data @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
                    ✔ Add more info and format @done(17:22 - 02/06/22)
              ✔ There's a lot of conditional operation going on. I think it's all necessary because of the variety and quality of data i have, but it's still a bit complicated at certain points as to what is being shown and what isn't. @done(17:41 - 01/06/22)
              ✔ I need to move the graphs into latest.js because that's where it should be. You will never get a graph without a country which is determined in the lasest stats file. @done(13:19 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ I'm realising my file structure is a bit of a mess. I think i need to do a bit of reorganising. The current search.js should be a container for a latest.js file(renamed to searchView.js) that contains the current latest.js and the graph.js components. @done(13:19 - 02/06/22)
              
              ✔ Improve the loading gif @done(17:57 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ ..by getting a better image @done(17:57 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ ..by spinning off into its own component. @done(17:44 - 02/06/22)
              ✔ Improve performance on smaller windows @done(18:05 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ ..Desktop is fine @done(17:29 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ ..tablet @done(18:05 - 02/06/22)
                  ✔ the disclaimer gets lost at the bottom of the page @done(18:05 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ ..mobile is fine as long as the dislcaimer gets fixed @done(18:05 - 02/06/22)
              ✔ Add an updated field to the slide @done(18:29 - 02/06/22)
                ✔ create a component for this @done(15:36 - 03/06/22)
              ✔ the latest stats display should have it's own component @done(18:17 - 02/06/22)
                .. it's taking a lot of space
              ✔ The ability to change the starting country from the UK @done(16:44 - 03/06/22)
                .. i feel like this is pretty easily done using local storage.
                  ..yup
                  ✔ Added the button, now just to finish of styling @done(16:44 - 03/06/22)

              ✔ The search functionality is case sensitive, anything I can do about this? @done(18:05 - 03/06/22)
                ..the main issue is that im doing multiple filters and Im having a hard time figuring out what to compare.
                ✔ I've figured out how to allow for case insensitive matches but now there's an issue where spain, Spain, sPaiN and SPAIn are all different things and can be favourited. @done(18:05 - 03/06/22)
                  ✔ I have solved this be converting everything to lower case when being compared and then displaying the country name in upper case. This has solved the issue. @done(18:05 - 03/06/22)

            ✔ In general i think being able to see the increase in cases from the previous 2 days would be quite useful @done(16:43 - 13/06/22)
            .. sum (today - yesterday) = increase in cases
              ✔ I think my data sources are way too different at this point, reporting different data from different sources. The graphs and stats are always going to be slightly different so it's mostly pointless @done(16:43 - 13/06/22)



          ✔ I think i need to take a step back and start from the basics. Im trying to shoehorn chart.js into my project without actually knowing how it fully works. Instead of using the covid data, i will create a small mini side project to help me get to grips with the library @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
          SimpleChart Side Project:
            ✔ Should use a fetch @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
            ✔ Be very simple, this is just to help with the covid19 dashboard. @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
              ✔ It is actually very simple and I was able to get good progress but Destiny 2 new season hype is too distracting @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
              ✔ Nothing too complicated here, you just need to get the data into the right format and it's plug and play. @done(16:28 - 31/05/22)
          
      
        ✔ Style / reformat buttons @done(16:03 - 06/06/22)
          ..they work but the current styling can be improved.
          ✔ first off all, swap them around. they're very annoying to use @done(16:03 - 06/06/22)

      Map View:
        ☐ On mobile, can you pinch to zoom the map in and out?
        ✔ Mobile -> Information panel is totally borked, fix the spacing here. @done(12:58 - 14/06/22)
        ✔ Mobile -> Information panel font size is ugly as hell @done(12:58 - 14/06/22)
        ☐ Mobile -> Perhaps, favouriting a country should happen after clicking anywhere in the name, rather than just the star which might be tricky to press
        ☐ Mobile -> The markers are way too big and in the wrong place, might be an issue.
        ☐ Mobile -> The loading dashboard signal should be in the middle of the page and in a column configuration
      Global Stats:
        ☐ Mobile -> Maybe increase the padding on the left and right as the bigger numbers are getting closer to the edges
        ☐ Mobile -> There's a lot of white space at the bottom of the page.
        ☐ Mobile -> The stats just look wonky, whats this about?
      Search:
        ☐ Mobile -> The title and the search bar are cramped, switch to flex column and change the colour of the search box to be sligtly easier to see.
          ☐ I think this can be spread the area straight below as well, way overcrowded here.
        ☐ Mobile -> Again, space around the borders is an issue here, especially in the updated string
        ☐ Mobile -> The disclaimer is halfway off the bottom of the page.
