React Snippets
https://github.com/dsznajder/vscode-react-javascript-snippets/blob/HEAD/docs/Snippets.md

Javascript:
  ✔ Calculator @done(12:30 - 04/05/22)
    Todo:
      ✔ Simple Sums @done(18:35 - 27/04/22)
      ✔ Decimal Places @done(16:52 - 29/04/22)
      ✘ CE Button - Cancel current input button @cancelled(15:49 - 29/04/22)
        .. removed this to help simplify things a little for me.
      ✔ AC Button - Clear all input button @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
        ✔ I think i've done it but more checking needed. @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
      ✔ Style calculator @done(12:30 - 03/05/22)
        ✔ I think i need to style the calculator to properly see where i need to improve. @done(15:50 - 29/04/22)
        .. that helped a lot. I should consider doing this as standard moving forward(style first -> build functionality.)

      ✘ At the moment the calculation takes place with the solve button, can this be changed to work on number instead? @cancelled(12:30 - 03/05/22)
      ✔ After solving, hitting a number should reset the entire thing. @done(17:26 - 29/04/22)
        ..this is important
        ✔ I think i've managed to achieve this. My codebase is a bombsite but it's doing what I want. @done(17:26 - 29/04/22)

      ✘ If a user hits the solve button without changing the second number, it shoudl solve the equation @cancelled(12:48 - 28/04/22)
        .. 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1.... but without pressing -1 over and over.
        Reason for cancelling -- I dont want this anymore but I think i can do something similiar with the show working function

      Reacitfy Calculator:
        ✔ Split content into separate components and functions. @done(17:33 - 03/05/22)


    Issues:
      ✔ There is some weirdness when subtract 1 from 0 @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
        .. it should solve to -1...right?
      ✔ The first time you add a second number, the display is set to 0 @done(15:51 - 29/04/22)
        .. it display the number on consecutive solves
        .. this is a presentational issue and doesn't appear to affect functionality
      
      ✔ Hitting a number then pressing an operator twice returns a weird output @done(12:15 - 03/05/22)
        .. 1 -> Hit 1
        .. 2 -> Hit + twice
        .. 3 -> result ---- 1 + = 1
        .. ideally you wouldnt be able to active the calculate without a second number

        ✔ Unexpected interactions to fix: @done(17:41 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ pressing a number then =, then attempting to add will return a NaN @done(12:28 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ 1 + 1 then solve, pressing decimal will add a decimal to the second number instead of resetting the display @done(12:24 - 03/05/22)
          ✔ 0 * 1 = 0, then pressing an operator will return a previous number of 1 @done(17:41 - 03/05/22)





  ✔ Simple CRUD @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
      ✔ did this with the todo @done(15:52 - 29/04/22)
  ✔ Search Box @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
      ✔ Created a basic search box with dummy data @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
      ✔ Can i apply this to the react micro projects page to search for tags? @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
        Yes, you can.Maybe:
          ✔ Part 1 - Map Components @done(18:55 - 04/05/22)
            ✔ This part was tricky to figure out and my sucesses here doesn't mean the search part is a given but I can now filter components using an object array I manually create. This should me I can filter that object array for names and tags. @done(18:54 - 04/05/22)

          ✔ Part 2 - Searchable Components @done(12:08 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Let's try filtering components. @done(18:58 - 04/05/22)
              .. You can just filter like any other array, the only thing that matters here is how you format the component part.
                .. In the array the component MUST not have quotes
                .. In the map it MUST look like -> <x.componentName /> as an example (componentName matches the object array)

          ✔ Part 3 - Refactoring code to work with new view @done(13:03 - 05/05/22)
            ..I had to create a new view component in order to get the search functionality working the way I want.
            .. Instead of everything being inside app.js, i have created view.js that will instead be the main wrapper for everything as I can't use state app.js.
            ✔ I have rearranged the code so that the page can be searched. The styles are off(the video is totally broken) but the goal of being able to search the components has been achieved. Now I just need to polish and tweak @done(13:03 - 05/05/22)
          
          ✔ Part 4 - Tweaking and Polishing @done(18:56 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Fix video @done(17:24 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Ability to search using tags @done(18:48 - 05/05/22)
            .. create and populate tags
            ✔ Remove old code @done(17:24 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Style search bar and have another look at the navbar @done(18:48 - 05/05/22)
            
          ✔ Part 5 - Upload to portfolio @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
            ✔ Everything is working @done(18:56 - 05/05/22)
            ✔ Moving On @done(12:52 - 06/05/22)
              ✔ One final thing @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ When searching, i think it should be clearer that a search has been performed. @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ Also it can be clearer what the search bar actually is. @done(12:03 - 06/05/22)
                  .. also consider just moving the search bar component further down
              ✔ I've just realised I can now add github links for each project @done(12:50 - 06/05/22)
                ✔ Do this. @done(12:50 - 06/05/22)

      ✔ Items arent symetrical as the p tag has a margin bottom tag pushing it up @done(12:23 - 22/04/22)
      ✔ Split up into components @done(11:49 - 25/04/22)
        ✔ Got most of it but arrived at the display list map and hit a block. The issue seems to be getting the proper index from the child component to the parent. @done(09:47 - 23/04/22)
      ✔ Assign bootstrap classnames instead of css @done(11:49 - 25/04/22)

  ✔ image slider @done(16:40 - 26/04/22)
      ✔ I thought i was finished but I just realised there is a gap at the edge of the slider container on larger windows. @done(16:40 - 26/04/22)
  
    pause:
      ✔ Clean up code across all previous tasks @done(18:37 - 26/04/22)
      ✔ Upload to portfolio @done(19:22 - 26/04/22)
        Upload Issues:
          ✔ The slider is not set to the correct size on load but resizing the windows sets it. @done(19:17 - 26/04/22)
            ✔ The issue was the useEffect hook setting the height before the images loaded in, i added a check to make sure the images were in place before setting the height of the div. @done(19:18 - 26/04/22)
      ✔ Wasnt there something about DNS changes @done(11:35 - 27/04/22)

          ✔ Upload to portfolio @done(11:29 - 27/04/22)
      ☐ look into code previews(i.e click om a button to view the project code for each of the tasks)
          ☐ Looked into it, seems a lot more work than I want to dedicate at this point.
      
  ☐ notebook
          .. This would just be a combo of todo + tabs
          
  ✔ simple api + fetch @done(18:39 - 09/05/22)
          Todo:
            .. Idea: a basic component that displays a random user using a button that cycles through and array of people
              ..A fake twitter profile
                
            ✘ Integrate the leaflet js library with the random user api coordinates @cancelled(17:32 - 09/05/22)
              ✔ Just added a link to google maps instead @done(17:32 - 09/05/22)
            ☐ The refresh button stops working after a number of presses.
              .. I can't figure out whats going on here. 
            ✔ Add a verfied tick button if the users age is an even number @done(17:50 - 09/05/22)
            ✔ This file is quite a mess, split it up into components so it's a bit easier to manage. @done(17:32 - 09/05/22)

            ✔ Bootstrapify css @done(18:39 - 09/05/22)

  

  RPM Pause:
    ✔ Convert github link to separate component and then... @done(11:07 - 10/05/22)
    ✔ ...add and information button, near the github link, that provides further context for each of the tasks. @done(18:13 - 10/05/22)
      ..this could be in the form of a simple modal that can be open and closed using the information button
      ✔ added the functionality, now just need to style @done(17:32 - 10/05/22)

  covid-19 dashboard using api:
    Inspiration..
      https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/8-reactjs-project-ideas-to-start-learning-by-doing/
    React Leaflet
      https://react-leaflet.js.org/
    Leaflet
      https://leafletjs.com/
    
    Goals:
      Target - https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
      ☐ Primary - A searchable resource for finding information about covid 19 info per country
      ☐ Primary = Ability to view information via a map
      ☐ Secondary - Using search to instanstly filter out countries
      ☐ Secondary - Ability to mark countrys for tracking(like a favourites button)

      ✔ Adjust size of project area to allow for wider/taller projects. @done(15:16 - 17/05/22)
        ..probably another new field in the component list file.
        ..yup, added a size field in component list and added a size check in RMPComponentView to check for size.

    Step 1: Find an Api:
      ☐ This is harder that i expected. The UK gov just returns a 500 internal server error.
        ..https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide/main-api
      ☐ Found one = https://disease.sh

    Step 2: Draw the rest of the rabbit:
      ✔ The data is constantly being called, how do i call it once? @done(11:15 - 12/05/22)
        .. add an empty dependency array in the use effect --> []
      ☐ console logging the data will return an error
      ☐ You can't map an object with a single value, that will return an error
      ✔ How about incorporating the simple slider ui here, having 3 different slides for each of the content @done(16:17 - 17/05/22)
        1.. for the stats, 2.. for the map, 3.. for the graphs
      ☐ Figure out how to add data in array together
      ✔ Having multiple fetches is probably not the best, figure out how to make a single function that fetches all URLS needed without having 40+ lines of code very similiar lines of code. @done(13:11 - 18/05/22)
        ✔ Pretty simply solved by using the Promise.all method. @done(13:11 - 18/05/22)

        Todo:
          UI.. 
          ✔ Global Stats Info @done(13:30 - 19/05/22)
          ☐ Map
            ☐ Learn how to integrate maps
            
            ..https://egghead.io/lessons/react-add-geojson-location-data-to-a-map-using-markers-and-popups-in-react-leaflet
            .. very relevant to what I want
            .. i think it's out of date, but a good starting point

            ..https://egghead.io/lessons/react-add-placename-location-search-to-react-leaflet-with-esri-leaflet-geocoder
            .. might also be useful for searching the map
            .. i think it's out of date, but a good starting point

            ☐ Look up destructuring in Js/React
              ..https://medium.com/@lcriswell/destructuring-props-in-react-b1c295005ce0
              ☐ Ok its not that complicated. It's just a simpler way of getting information from an array.
              ☐ For example, instead of doing something 
                const name = props.name
                const id = props.id
                const age = props.id
              ☐ you can do..
                const {name, id, age} = props
              ☐ and just use name, id and age without the props. part.
            ☐ So, be sure to change this in the covid 19 dashboard and to use this moving forward.
            ☐ THe search box needs to be reworked. The data can be downloaded and loaded inside the search.js component rather than being set in the main Covid19Dashboard
            ☐ Format Tooltips
            ☐ Format markers
            ☐ Search for country and fly to it.
            ☐ The 3 slides(covodi9DashboardView.js) can be mapped similiar to the component list. This will let me dynamically add more slides with relevant css, without needing to manually adjust in the css file.
            ☐ The map is just a mess on smaller windows.
          
        ☐ Graphs (search.js)
          Goal:
            ☐ You can search a country and get a chart visualising various pieces of data from that country
            Notes
              .. The API data isn't laid out exactly how I would like it with differences in how country data is reported eg. USA gets 1 array for 50 states, Canada gets 15 arrays for each of its provinces and the UK gets arrays for all of its overseas territories and dependencies but NOT the 4 countries that make up the UK.
              .. Short of figuring out a way of adding value in arrays to other arrays, I am just going to accept I can't have graphs for all countries that list data like this.
          
          Todo:
            ☐ 2 sections
              ☐ 1st Section - Search Box - Latest Data
                ☐ Add more info and format
              ☐ 2nd Section - Graphs - Timeline Data
                  ☐ Add more info and format 
            ✔ There's a lot of conditional operation going on. I think it's all necessary because of the variety and quality of data i have, but it's still a bit complicated at certain points as to what is being shown and what isn't. @done(17:41 - 01/06/22)
            ☐ I need to move the graphs into latest.js because that's where it should be. You will never get a graph without a country which is determined in the lasest stats file.
              ☐ I'm realising my file structure is a bit of a mess. I think i need to do a bit of reorganising. The current search.js should be a container for a latest.js file(renamed to searchView.js) that contains the current latest.js and the graph.js components.
              

          ✔ I think i need to take a step back and start from the basics. Im trying to shoehorn chart.js into my project without actually knowing how it fully works. Instead of using the covid data, i will create a small mini side project to help me get to grips with the library @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
          SimpleChart Side Project:
            ✔ Should use a fetch @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
            ✔ Be very simple, this is just to help with the covid19 dashboard. @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
              ✔ It is actually very simple and I was able to get good progress but Destiny 2 new season hype is too distracting @done(16:27 - 31/05/22)
              ✔ Nothing too complicated here, you just need to get the data into the right format and it's plug and play. @done(16:28 - 31/05/22)
          
      
        ☐ Style / reformat buttons
          ..they work but the current styling can be improved.

  ☐ Drag and Drop functionality
  ☐ Something with react leaflet and maps
        ..https://egghead.io/lessons/react-add-shapes-to-a-map-in-react-leaflet
